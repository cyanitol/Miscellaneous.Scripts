#Restore Instructions
# created a VM which is big enough at some cloud provider
#booted it with the provided rescue system
#downloaded restic to /usr/local/bin, checked the repo with restic â€¦ snapshots -> worked
#mounted the harddisk at /mnt/restore and did restic restore to that target.
#did a chroot to /mnt/restore, grub2-install, grub2-mkconfig, dracut -f
#changed fstab to the correct UUID
#recreate /swapfile
